# Document generation

The inline Fortran documentation is Markdown-based, using FORD.
If source code or documentation edits are made, the documentation is regenerated from the top-level gemini directory by:

```sh
ford ford.md
```

The output is under `doc/` and upon `git push` will appear at the
[GEMINI docs website](https://gemini3d.github.io/gemini/index.html).

## Install FORD

FORD is a Python program, installed via:

```sh
pip install ford
```

Note: leave the LaTeX files and other non-autogenerated documents in `docs/` so they don't get disturbed by FORD.
